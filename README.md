GALURA Particle Motion HW - GDPHYSX XX22

Hello Sir Richmond!
I have opted to work solo for the first assignment on Particle Motion.
I am not too familiar with GitHub so I would like to ask of you to 
notify me if the executable files do not function properly here in the
GitHub repository. I will send you the .exe file with the necessary
files in a ZIP file.

Thank you!
